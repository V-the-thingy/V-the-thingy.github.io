<center>â€œDuring the first few weeks of my IT level 2 course I was instructed to make a website for a fictonal Cafe which had to include a Homepage, a page about the menu items and finally a contact page for people who would want to work there. Unfortunately, I got sick for like a week and I never got to finish it, but I'll show you dear reader all I managed to get done if you want to look at them for whatever reason.</i><br></br>

    </center>This is the home page of the website, which gives you a basic overview of the website and tells you the backstory/lore of the Cafe. The name is a pun off of the initials of East Kent college; EKC. EKC, yEast Kent Coffee, get it? It's not funny I know. THe whole deal with EKC (The fictional Cafe not the Corporate Business) is that it's one big decrepit, revolting, crumbling-to-ashes-and-dust health code violation that only stays open by marketing itslef as some kind of "Vaccine service" where you drink the off-date Coffee so you get ill but ill enough that your body can learn to fight against the "SUPER DUPER VIRUSES OF THE NEW AGE!!!" I know I said "find" instead of "fight" on the website but that was a typo (spelling mistake).</center>
