    <br></br>
<center>During the first few weeks of my IT level 2 course I was instructed to make a website for a fictonal Cafe which had to include a Homepage, a page about the menu items and finally a contact page for people who would want to work there. Unfortunately, I got sick for like a week and I never got to finish it, but I'll show you dear reader all I managed to get done if you want to look at them for whatever reason.</i><br></br>
    <center><img src="Cafe website.png" width="75%" alt="A screenshot from of my terrible, terrible cafe website."> </center>
    <center>This is the home page of the website, which gives you a basic overview of the website and tells you the backstory/lore of the Cafe. The name is a pun off of the initials of East Kent college; EKC. EKC, yEast Kent Coffee, get it? It's not funny I know. THe whole deal with EKC (The fictional Cafe not the Corporate Business) is that it's one big decrepit, revolting, crumbling-to-ashes-and-dust health code violation that only stays open by marketing itslef as some kind of "Vaccine service" where you drink the off-date Coffee so you get ill but ill enough that your body can learn to fight against the "SUPER DUPER VIRUSES OF THE NEW AGE!!!" I know I said "find" instead of "fight" on the website but that was a typo (spelling mistake).</center>
    <center><img src="cafe website 2.png" width="75%" alt="Another screenshot from my terrible, terriblr cafe website."></center>
    <center>This is the Menu page of the website, this was around when I got sick with... whatever weird sharp stomach pain thing I have so I didn't manage to get much work done before I got to work on this website instead. The only thing here is a pricing for a mold cup of coffee and to be honest I'm not too proud of it. It could've used some white space of at least a smaller text box because the line of text at the top and bottom doesn't need THAT much space when they're just one sentance. The image is also way too big for literally no reason whatsoever when it doesn't need to be. I swear I can count each individual pixel on that thing!!!</center> 
    <center><img src="cafe website 3.png" width="75%" alt="One final screenshot from my terrible, terriblr cafe website."></center>
    <center>This is the final, horriblest page on the website, the contact page. I only got to work on it for like 5 minutes so thats why it looks so terrible. I mean... the text there does give you all you need for a contact page except for an adress abd the image fits well with the run-down moldy vibe of the website I guess... I don't have anything else to say for this.</center>
    <p></p>
    <center>That was all I had to show for my Cafe website, if you want to visit it yourself then you can go to "My work", then "Term 1", then "My Cafe website". I hope This website is much better than the Cafe website and I'm sorry if I ended up giving you Melanoma from how it looked.</center>
