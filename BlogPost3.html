<center>â€œDuring the first few weeks of my IT level 2 course I was instructed to make a website for a fictonal Cafe which had to include a Homepage, a page about the menu items and finally a contact page for people who would want to work there. Unfortunately, I got sick for like a week and I never got to finish it, but I'll show you dear reader all I managed to get done if you want to look at them for whatever reason.</i><br></br>
