<div class="title">Growing Up Blind (not Literally) and Learning to See</div>
<br></br>
In my 16 (almost 17 years) of being alive there has been many things I have had to learn on my own, without much help from other people, and one of these things was learning to have an opinion. Ever since I was a wee child I had been influenced by many sources to just go along with what everyone else says and base your opinions on other people's opinions, and it was the worst time ever. I didn't have the BEST influences around me, most people in my life being negaive, soul-sucking-in-black holes which unknowingly turned everyone around them into more black holes like a pandemic of pestamists, and I couldn't think for myself back then so I just adopted their negativity and became a black-hole myself. I thought everything was horrible, including myself and others, and I became hateful, judging everyone I didn't understand (except gay and bi people but that was only because I was gay for a short period of time and bi for a few years) because everyone else did. I was a horrible person who was terrified of being horrible, who thought they were horrible but they were actually horrible in a different way... and then it happened.

<div class="title">September, 2023</div>
<br></br>
Before I came to EKC dover I was at Ripplevale School in Deal, an all boys school for people with learning Disabilities, and I was autistic. So, should I felt like I belonged? yes. Did I? ...No, No I didn't. Around early September I started to realise how different I was to everyone around me, most people around me were either rude, sports fanatics, spoke like they were a 53 year old wife abusing dad, were in a hivemind of big meaty masculine men or just didn't really care about other people... and then there was me. I was quiet, cared a great deal about my friends and even just random people, I tried to talk more softly than the people around me, hated sports and preferred to just be on my own or with 2 friends who were also quiet. And I was the only one who acted like this, in my entire year group. The. Only. One. It was so, so lonely. I wanted more friends who I could relate to but everyone else was what I described before or were somewhat nice but I could never really relate to them and it was so, so confusing. I started feeling confused in myself and the world around me and... I started getting an opinion of myself, who I was and how other people are... but that was baby steps. The real change started on

<div class="title">October 27th, 2023</div>
<br></br>
This was the day my life changed forever. And I mean FOREVER. Not like a day or a week or a year, what happened that day had changed EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE AFTER THAT DAY, and things will never go back to how they were before. I had just finished watching the FNAF movie with my brother at I think 9pm? We had to go into a taxi building because there were no buses home and there was none we could call. A little bit after we got in there this big, hulking construction worker/painter guy came in and sat down to the polar opposite end of me and my brother, and the both of them talked for a bit. I think I counted 51 F words by the time we left? Something more than 50. On the taxi ride home I started thinking about how that man was my opposite, everything I didn't like in other people. Rude, Swears a lot, big and muscly (only in men tho... for some reason.), overly masculine, had a insanely scratchy deep voice, was uncaring, he was EVERYTHING I didn't like in people... everything I didn't want to end up being... all of that was... everything I just described... then, it happened. I realised why I had been feeling so odd and different all this time, it was because I was different. From him, from my brother, from my friends, from everyone. I realised there was something different with me and that I would never be like other people, and it was the worst moment of my life.

<div class="title">The Aftermath</div>
I'm not going to tell you what I learned (SUPER PERSONAL STUFF FLIPFLOP OFF) but I will tell you what happened after, I got my own opinions. I started seeing the world the way I saw it, not how other people saw them. I started liking things other that people didn't, I start liking people that other people didn't, I even eventually started liking myself but that took almost a year. Now, I'm not negative, or hateful, or judgeful, or any of the other things I said. Now, I'm me... or as close to me as I can be for the time being. nobody really knows ME, they know what "I" look like and how "I" sound and how "I" act but thats not me, none of that is me anymore. I'm fine with just being on my own though, it allows me to have more time to think about the people I care about and more time to think about me and my sense of self, and it's just kinda nice. If I had ONE piece of advise for the people reading this, it would be to explore yourself (NOT IN THAT WAY EW DISGUSTING GET OUT), or more or less explore your sense of self. If you start questioning yourself and how you are, maybe you'll learn about the less desirable parts of you that you can improve upon, maybe you'll learn something about other people by learning stuff about yourself, or maybe you'll learn you've been living your life as someone else for the longest time... and if thats the case then theres one thing I wanna say
