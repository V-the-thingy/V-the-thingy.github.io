<div class="title">Allan Callaghan - Industry Visitor Reflection.</div>
<br></br>
This blog post is about a visit from a person called "Allan Callaghan" who was the Tutor for one of our Tutors Ross on the 9th of December. This is really only for College/CV reasons so you can just skip this one if you are some one who isn't an importanty joby person who I gave access to my website for whatever reason.
<br></br>
<div class="title">Introduction</div>
<br></br>
On Tuesday (9th of november) we had Ross’ tutor who helped him become a teacher come into our classroom to show us how to make an entire human genome made out of python code and then use a website to search for a very specific line of protiens which was GTAC, then a A or a C, a random letter from G, T, A or C and then 2 more T’s. I was expecting him to just talk about his past experiences with teaching ross to be a teacher but it was really nice to see some Science mixed up with Computing… almost if it was… GASP, COMPUTER SCIENCE. I could have never foreseen this. (I’m being sarcastic but it was really nice to have elements of other academic subjects be mixed in with the computing work.)
<br></br>
<div class="title">Description of the Activity</div>
<br></br>
We were given 2 pieces of paper, both with very large strings of protiens which were either A, C, G or T which all together makes up human DNA. We were tasked to identify the faulty strand of DNA I mentioned earlier using only our own inefficient human eyes. Unsurprisingly, nobody found it. We then coded in a program in W3sSchools web-coding website using Python which outputted 2 different human genomes, which we then put in a website (I’ve forgotten the name) to see if the faulty strand was a part of either of the genomes, which it was in the 1st strand (for me at least). We were then asked about how this technology could be used and I do believe that was everything.
<br></br>
<div class="title">Personal Experience</div>
<br></br>
The coding and finding pattern parts were very simple to understand. Ross’ tutor described what and why certain parts of the code were important and what they did. Something I learnt that was quite interesting was that all the white mice that you typically see being used for science in media are in-fact, all the same mouse. They all have the exact DNA, which also means all the white mice in the world are all related. It’s interesting that cloning is completely possible without any more complicated science than just mice reproducing normally, while it took us thousands of years to even clone a sheep. What other mysteries does nature have that we haven’t discovered yet?
<br></br>
<div class="title">Future Applications</div>
<br></br>
The fact we were able to create an entire human genome using Python of all things astounded me. I know I could probably make one in scratch out of all programming languages, but it fascinates me that there could be a world were perfect humans are selected or even MADE from an algorithm. This made me think that maybe there is more to coding and computing than just making programs for entertainment or productivity, that perhaps there is more science in computing than just electricity. It also reminded me of how much I love Science, it’s not a thing I’ll do for a job, but it could be a nice side hobby to break up the more art and art-like hobbies I have. 
<br></br>
<div class="title">Conclusion</div>
<br></br>
The visit was a really nice refresher in the course, to be honest recently I’ve started to have my view of technology go from “WOW THIS IS SO COOL AND AMAZING WOWOWOWOW” to “...eh”. Everything I thought was super super complicated and took a lot of skill to make just turned out to be very simple and the mystery of it all just kind of faded. But now, I have a new out look on Computing, now I see it can be used for more than just sorting out customer accounts for a shopping website and streaming episodes of The Cleveland Show at 270p, it can be used for Science! We could actually end up cloning humans, reveresing gravity, all the things Sci-Fi novels warn us against doing! If a computer can easily produce a whole Human genome, one of the most complicated things in the human body (well it IS the human body but still); with just a tiny bit of code, perhaps there is more to technology that we have learnt in these first two terms. Oh and the activity was really enjoyable! It was simplistic, short, and didn’t over-stay its welcome. I can see where Ross got his excelent teaching skills from now!
